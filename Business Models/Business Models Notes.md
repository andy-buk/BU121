What is a business model?
- A business model describes the rationale of how an organization creates, captures and delivers value to customers. It is needed together with your product idea - it's the center of a business model, but not the actual business itself. 

Why should we use business models?
- Business models are important and used because they simplify complexity! They are comparatively easily mutable and can clarify understanding of critical components of your business.
- Business models are developed by thinking about your purpose, continual prototyping, understanding the business environment and testing/proving hypothesis. They are also susceptible to change - seek feedback, poke holes in logic, and challenge the assumptions of a model to continuously improve it.

	- Channels
	- Customer Relationships

	- Key Activities
	- Key Resources

Logic & Integration between building blocks
- Decisions made in one prat of the model impacts the rest.
- The choice of models impacts the organization's strategy.

Business Model Patterns
- Brick & Mortar
	- Selling products/services in 1+ physical locations
- Clicks/E-Commerce
	- Selling from a website only
- Bricks & Clicks
	- Selling products/services in 1+ physical locations & selling from a website
- Bait & Hook
	- Lock customers in with a base product (the bait) in order to generate recurring revenues from a consumable (the hook) that customers need recurrently to benefit from the base product.
- Multi-Sided Platform
	- Value is created by facilitating interactions between two or more distinct but interdependent groups of customers.
	- Of value to one group only if the other groups of customers are also present - and grows in value to the extent that it attracts more users - network effect.
	- Often solved by one segment subsidizing another.
- Freemium
	- Offer basic products and services free of charge and premium services and advanced product features for a fee.
	- The best freemium models acquire a large customer base and excel in converting a substantial percentage to paid users.

Social Business
- They aim to achieve both social and financial value - a social impact along with financial return. Some reinvest all profits (social businesses), others are purpose-driven for profit enterprises.
