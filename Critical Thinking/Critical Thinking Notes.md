What is critical thinking?
- A cognitive process of actively and carefully evaluating the reasoning and evidence behind knowledge and arguments and developing defensible knowledge and arguments ourselves.

Characterizing different types of thinkers
|                          | Shallow Thinker                             | Cynical Thinker                                                 | Critical Thinker                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Approaches to knowledge  | Early stage: search for 'correct' knowledge | Intermediate stage: rejection of all knowledge                  | High stage: accept ability to evaluate knowledge                             |
| Approaches to argument   | Follower: blindly accept arguments          | Cynic: automatically reject arguments                           | Healthy sceptic: actively evaluate arguments based on reasoning and evidence |
| Approaches to persuasion | Persuaded by pathos                         | Not susceptible to persuasion                                   | Persuaded by logos (with judicious use of ethos)                             |
| Cognitive processes      | Remember, understand, possibly apply        | Full spectrum but may have difficulty with objective evaluation | Full spectrum especially higher-order; analyze, evaluate, and create         |
| Cognitive biases         | Unaware                                     | Aware but unconcerned                                           | Aware and aim to avoid                                                                             |

What do we learn at university?
- Learn foundational knowledge
- Build universal skills
- Work on personal characteristics
- An open mindset is needed for academic and social growth
- Growth mindset is needed to develop and improve

An argument and its components
- Having an argument = a disagreement or fight
- Making an argument = presenting a position and supporting it with reasons
- A claim = a position or answer
- A premise = reason
- A link = connection between claim and premise
- Supporting premises = premises presented to support the direct premise to the claim
- Counter argument = premises which do not support our claim
- Rebuttals = responses explaining why the counter argument is either invalid or does not weaken the main argument

Types of evidence
| Examples (including anecdotes)                                            | Research findings (including statistics)                                                   | Knowledge from other sources |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Especially helpful to demonstrate or explain a premise or claim           | Very useful, especially where the knowledge produced is reliable and/or source is credible | Credibility of the source of this knowledge is critical                             |
| Use carefully to avoid purporting to 'prove' something they are unable to | Statistics are a numerical representation of an underlying reality (use carefully)         |                              |

Reliability of knowledge
- From more likely to less likely: 
	-  Fact by definition/discovery -> Factual belief/claim -> Judgement/Opinion -> Prejudice
	- Academic writings -> Audited/reputable reports -> respected media/curated online videos/Consultant/Think tank/NGO reports -> Wikipedia -> Company sites -> news media -> Blogs and uncurated online videos.

What is critical thinking?::A cognitive process of actively and carefully evaluating the reasoning and evidence behind knowledge and arguments and developing defensible knowledge and arguments ourselves.
Shallow Thinker::Early stage: search for 'correct' knowledge. Follower: blindly accept arguments. Persuaded by pathos. Remember, understand, possibly apply. Unaware of biases.
Cynical Thinker::Intermediate stage: rejection of all knowledge. Cynic: automatically reject arguments. Not susceptible to persuasion. Full spectrum but may have difficulty with objective evaluation. Aware but unconcerned about biases.
Critical Thinker::High stage: accept ability to evaluate knowledge. Healthy sceptic: actively evaluate arguments based on reasoning and evidence. Persuaded by logos (with judicious use of ethos). Full spectrum especially higher-order; analyze, evaluate, and create. Aware and aim to avoid biases.
