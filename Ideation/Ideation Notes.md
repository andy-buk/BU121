How do we evaluate ideas?
- Ideas are evaluated based on desirability, feasibility and viability. 
- Desirability:
	- Is the problem big or small?
	- Are customers trying to solve the problem?
	- How often does this problem occur?
	- Do current solutions exist?
	- How many customers have this problem? Is this customer market growing?
- Feasibility:
	- Do you have or can access skills and technology to provide a unique and valuable solution?
	- Can you reach your target customers?
	- Can you access required suppliers and partners?
	- Can you protect your solution from competitors?
- Viability:
	- Is the problem big or small?
	- How often does this problem occur?
	- How many customers have this problem? Is this customer market growing?
	- Can you reach the customers who are currently dissatisfied?
	- Does my solution leverage current and forward-looking trends and innovations?
	- Can I generate sufficient revenue to cover my expenses?
- These will ensure that you have a unique and valuable solution to a problem.
